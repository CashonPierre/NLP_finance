2024-12-30 23:48:38.254000 | zovirs#0 | Will BRICS help them to overthrow USA? Idk about that
2024-12-30 23:48:36.385000 | monkeyrithms#0 | we could call game theory also a sort of common sense (well maybe its not so common?)

but no.. people do not stop at multipolarity or equality

a multi-polar world will still see competition among the poles to be the dominant one.
2024-12-30 23:48:07.474000 | zovirs#0 | Why would the Russians , Chinese ever want USA to be the global power ?
2024-12-30 23:47:34.446000 | zovirs#0 | I mean it‚Äôs common sense
2024-12-30 23:47:12.356000 | monkeyrithms#0 | that's what they all say

"multipolarity" until you get the chance to be the dominant one

then see how quick _that_ narrative changes. üòÇ
2024-12-30 23:46:44.095000 | zovirs#0 | That‚Äôs what they believe
2024-12-30 23:46:29.253000 | zovirs#0 | They want a era of multipolarity, the hegemony of one country on the worlds stage is over
2024-12-30 23:45:17.915000 | monkeyrithms#0 | not that NK would ever do something that twisted
2024-12-30 23:45:08.029000 | zovirs#0 | In short overthrowing USA
2024-12-30 23:44:55.850000 | monkeyrithms#0 | but it would be so much fun üôÇ

getting sent to Ukraine as soldiers to help the motherland, as cannon fodder, would bring great sense of adventure as a north korean

2024-12-30 23:23:15.124000 | sir7160#0 | If I were them, I would absolutely do the same. Their net worth is essentially the value of their respective networks.
2024-12-30 23:22:53.147000 | sir7160#0 | I have this theory that CZ and Justin Sun long / short BTC and ETH, and cycle the profits back to BNB and TRX, respectively. I think their activities actively fuck with the wicks on the various L1s.

2024-12-30 19:24:06.211000 | sir7160#0 | CZ and co keep pumping value into it.
2024-12-30 19:23:51.323000 | sir7160#0 | Oh absolutely
2024-12-30 19:23:48.051000 | sir7160#0 | And if BNB flywheels itself, it could go sky high.
2024-12-30 19:23:45.177000 | chinesecat888#0 | i remember the $22 days
2024-12-30 19:23:37.230000 | chinesecat888#0 | its so weird seeing bnb at $700 tho lol

2024-12-30 19:23:05.294000 | sir7160#0 | It‚Äôs an alright coin imo.

2024-12-30 19:22:22.284000 | sir7160#0 | It‚Äôs basically like if ETH had a CEX dedicated to its‚Äô usage.
2024-12-30 19:22:19.524000 | chinesecat888#0 | yes liquidity markets
2024-12-30 19:22:06.820000 | sir7160#0 | More usecase than 99.997% of the market.
2024-12-30 19:21:52.240000 | sir7160#0 | BNB is a significantly more fleshed out coin than basically any other coin out there.
2024-12-30 19:21:34.239000 | sir7160#0 | BNB is used for liquidity markets on Binance, it‚Äôs used for fees and shit on Binance, it‚Äôs used for Launchpad shit on Binance, it‚Äôs used on BSC as gas for the network, and it‚Äôs basically the entirety of CZ‚Äôs fortune. I believe in CZ (and his greediness) almost as much as I believe in Satoshi.

2024-12-30 19:09:19.121000 | chinesecat888#0 | doesn't a lot of new coins on binance require bnb liquidity or something?

2024-12-30 18:51:54.724000 | sir7160#0 | I demand that my lawyer convert my entire wealth into BTC upon my death, and transfer it to 0x000dead. My final wish is to help the greater btc community.
2024-12-30 18:51:40.976000 | monkeyrithms#0 | no. no, of course not.
2024-12-30 18:51:27.486000 | chinesecat888#0 | surely no one will steal it

2024-12-30 18:49:47.641000 | monkeyrithms#0 | hmm, yeah I guess if I fully lean into that it would be time to withdraw it all and just go have fun for a while lol

2024-12-30 18:47:39.440000 | monkeyrithms#0 | take it with me as in, we dont know if we might die tomorrow and if we do, it was all meaningless?

like, "live more in the moment" is sort of the message?

2024-12-30 18:42:59.084000 | monkeyrithms#0 | its why i think maybe if you start out not-wealthy you might appreciate or be smarter with your wealth as you make it?

because you've experienced firsthand more stratifications of it
2024-12-30 18:42:52.504000 | sir7160#0 | Change the comparison and it helps significantly.
2024-12-30 18:42:50.154000 | Deleted User#0000 | This is why I have little sympathy or patience for the wailing entitlements of the first world's poor: it is a demonstration of their own spiritual bankruptcy
2024-12-30 18:42:28.398000 | sir7160#0 | I could get liquidated and I‚Äôm still going to have a life of luxury compared to African poors.
2024-12-30 18:42:18.892000 | monkeyrithms#0 | yes. this is how the brain works

perception is largely dependent on comparison to others
2024-12-30 18:42:03.847000 | sir7160#0 | This is a big struggle of mine, but something that has helped me thru this losing position.
2024-12-30 18:41:45.240000 | sir7160#0 | Facts
2024-12-30 18:41:23.563000 | Deleted User#0000 | An objective survey of wealth disparity would have us recognize even the poorest American living a life of incredibly luxury compared to not just the median of human history (and certainly his own ancestral line) but even the median of human existence today. Yet this does nothing to alleviate his feeling of poverty
2024-12-30 18:40:33.948000 | Deleted User#0000 | Poverty, the experience of scarcity, is an illusion; the scarcity is always defined against the relative other, and like wealth, is experienced at any class. This is how it's possible that the "poverty epidemic" is greater in the first world than the third world, because the former has more greatly eroded the social barriers between the classes, greatly increasing experienced wealth disparity
2024-12-30 18:40:01.766000 | monkeyrithms#0 | yup i started out thinking about $ amount and how much it can buy, but now i have reconditioned myself to only care about the % up and down of the account balances (and withdraw = down which adds friction)
2024-12-30 18:39:29.767000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | aixbt might be topped for now
2024-12-30 18:39:08.751000 | wilfstudio#0 | i dont even want the money to buy anything i just like seeing the number go up xdd
2024-12-30 18:38:42.708000 | monkeyrithms#0 | i thought the point was lambo on the moon... i better rethink all of this üòÇ

2024-12-30 18:37:56.939000 | monkeyrithms#0 | i live pretty frugally
2024-12-30 18:37:55.028000 | sir7160#0 | I think of it as‚Ä¶
The decisions / mindset that brought me to that amount of profitability is exactly the reason I‚Äôll never buy one.

Buying a lambo is exactly the opposite of the point of BTC.

2024-12-30 18:36:26.439000 | monkeyrithms#0 | isnt it funny, by the time you can afford those things, you learned along the journey to affording them that they're not very smart things to buy and you become conditioned to wanting to reinvest profits instead

2024-12-30 18:33:07.798000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | im not sure if we have bottomed or we will continue down, nothing has changed as far as my strategy goes, we wait for confirmation one way or the other
2024-12-30 18:33:02.349000 | sir7160#0 | No worries! I love showing new things
2024-12-30 18:32:53.053000 | sir7160#0 | And v2 has more liquidity than v3 still lmao
2024-12-30 18:32:49.891000 | monkeyrithms#0 | see I'm still learning this. üòÖ thank you
2024-12-30 18:32:43.347000 | sir7160#0 | V2 and v3 are still working
2024-12-30 18:32:26.900000 | sir7160#0 | V3 is concentrated ranges, yeah
2024-12-30 18:32:15.341000 | sir7160#0 | V2 is a basic implementation of simple swaps.
2024-12-30 18:32:11.235000 | chinesecat888#0 | u can select the range u wanna "mm" for
2024-12-30 18:32:10.304000 | monkeyrithms#0 | ohh
2024-12-30 18:32:04.265000 | sir7160#0 | V1 has been completely de-spun.

2024-12-30 18:31:26.351000 | _jozef_.#0 | im little bit new here so im just tryna understand
2024-12-30 18:31:02.388000 | _jozef_.#0 | is BTC gonna keep bearish or is he gonna pick its liquidation in 98k ?
2024-12-30 18:30:30.374000 | monkeyrithms#0 | v3?
2024-12-30 18:29:59.526000 | sir7160#0 | Using a non-nominal amount of funds.
2024-12-30 18:29:47.014000 | sir7160#0 | I would like to see your research regarding v3 vs your strategy.
2024-12-30 18:29:45.227000 | chinesecat888#0 | yee hyperliquid is cool
2024-12-30 18:29:10.933000 | monkeyrithms#0 | I have not

Im checking that out for 2025.. no idea how it will go üòÖ

2024-12-30 18:29:08.628000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | idk what you are asking here

2024-12-30 18:28:45.430000 | _jozef_.#0 | so guys im little bit new here so now that BTC just took its liquidation from 91 k to 92 k is it gonna go up and pick the liquidation on 98k or its gonna keep bearish ?
2024-12-30 18:28:44.091000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Market is open tomorrow but closed the day after, remember this
2024-12-30 18:28:16.989000 | sir7160#0 | Wicks and empty range tend to fill.
2024-12-30 18:27:58.189000 | sir7160#0 | Look at the empty range.
2024-12-30 18:27:49.525000 | sir7160#0 | Covering the drop from the weekend.
2024-12-30 18:27:48.858000 | chinesecat888#0 | since u can get tighter spreads
2024-12-30 18:27:45.757000 | Deleted User#0000 | So we trade the range until it breaks
2024-12-30 18:27:42.058000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | no news is good news
2024-12-30 18:27:38.781000 | Deleted User#0000 | We havent fell out of the bottom of the range yet
2024-12-30 18:27:31.073000 | gravijiga#0 | My stocks also pumped suddenly, what‚Äôs going on? I don‚Äôt see any huge news
2024-12-30 18:27:26.802000 | chinesecat888#0 | its pretty nice for stablecoins too
2024-12-30 18:27:14.012000 | chinesecat888#0 | yee v3 is better if u know what you're doing
2024-12-30 18:27:11.013000 | DegenBot#9193 | 
2024-12-30 18:26:41.815000 | sir7160#0 | 0.3% is a lie.
2024-12-30 18:26:36.529000 | sir7160#0 | V2 had proven issues with payouts, too.
2024-12-30 18:26:34.868000 | chinesecat888#0 | and takes too much time
2024-12-30 18:26:28.633000 | chinesecat888#0 | too complicated for no reason
2024-12-30 18:26:25.413000 | sir7160#0 | Por que? V3 with infinite range is basically v2.
2024-12-30 18:26:07.921000 | chinesecat888#0 | not really a big fan of uni v3 anymore
2024-12-30 18:26:07.651000 | sir7160#0 | Shorts finally closed and covered?
2024-12-30 18:25:41.161000 | sir7160#0 | I agree. That‚Äôs why I asked about news.
2024-12-30 18:25:31.449000 | sir7160#0 | But v2 on memes is also an arguably good bet
2024-12-30 18:25:21.040000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | there's something we aren't seeing
2024-12-30 18:25:17.594000 | sir7160#0 | Uni v3 Concentrated is my main question.
2024-12-30 18:25:15.114000 | chinesecat888#0 | bcs memecoins go hand in hand with dex
2024-12-30 18:25:12.883000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | but it can't be this easy
2024-12-30 18:25:07.763000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | mine too

2024-12-30 18:25:02.029000 | sir7160#0 | I‚Äôve asked. Monkey hasn‚Äôt tested.
2024-12-30 18:24:54.291000 | sir7160#0 | All my longs are relying on this move up
2024-12-30 18:24:50.216000 | chinesecat888#0 | have u ever done LP's on dex? (liquidity pools) how different is it from market making on cex?

2024-12-30 18:23:07.880000 | monkeyrithms#0 | it seems so
2024-12-30 18:22:57.830000 | monkeyrithms#0 | yes, but somewhere around the green line, the ratio of speculators to MM's changed pretty dramatically.. so there's fewer MMs playing that game compared to the people buying/selling at market now

that tips the scales in favor of MM (as far as "which edge or arbitrage is most available")
2024-12-30 18:22:43.801000 | sir7160#0 | A big guy exited his MM

2024-12-30 18:16:54.099000 | monkeyrithms#0 | https://www.tradingview.com/x/7oiTwE9m here, look at this

notice right around Christmas day, the level of noise in the market jumped substantially... if you assess the properties of the price-action before and after the green line

this is often a very large market-maker pulling liquidity during periods of high speculation (who knows why)... and it opens a huge edge for new makers

This condition is persisting to this day ü§î
2024-12-30 18:16:38.874000 | chinesecat888#0 | type shit
2024-12-30 18:15:57.302000 | sir7160#0 | A sharp move up to liquidate the shorts seems pretty obvious.
2024-12-30 18:15:44.008000 | sir7160#0 | Like that
2024-12-30 18:15:41.656000 | sir7160#0 | Something stupid

2024-12-30 18:13:00.840000 | monkeyrithms#0 | just started trading perps for that on Phemex

there is an interesting market regime, or "condition", that is present in that market right now

2024-12-30 18:11:39.990000 | Deleted User#0000 | Works as intended, there is always a trade off
2024-12-30 18:11:12.775000 | sir7160#0 | I was promised a decentralized deflationary Turing complete contractable currency.

I‚Äôm just complaining about the ‚Äúdeflationary‚Äù part. ETH is still revolutionary.
2024-12-30 18:11:08.948000 | zovirs#0 | Still not solved

2024-12-30 18:10:56.671000 | Deleted User#0000 | Which is why we are seeing last cycles prices with $20 fees not $1000 fees

2024-12-30 18:09:49.279000 | sir7160#0 | BTC did, in fact, inflate more.
2024-12-30 18:09:37.927000 | Deleted User#0000 | 1) u dont care
2) btc inflated more
2024-12-30 18:09:34.948000 | sir7160#0 | Like, SIGNIFICANTLY less.
2024-12-30 18:09:34.915000 | chinesecat888#0 | i feel like the gas fees will be even crazier than last cycle if eth picks up again
2024-12-30 18:09:18.756000 | sir7160#0 | Still significantly less of a mint rate than before merge

2024-12-30 17:57:36.198000 | sir7160#0 | Yes, but mint rate has been above deflate rate recently.
2024-12-30 17:57:24.610000 | sir7160#0 | That‚Äôs what we need. A community driven deflationary token, to match with BTC being digital gold.

2024-12-30 17:56:27.668000 | sir7160#0 | Yes, but we haven‚Äôt been burning ETH in a while.

2024-12-30 17:32:38.715000 | sir7160#0 | If BNB plummets, that‚Äôs bear; BNB is held up by traders that are betting for / against BTC. So if they stop trading and BNB plummets, while BTC plummets, it‚Äôs bear.

2024-12-30 17:19:02.886000 | mr_copy#0 | I just figured out taxing in germany is still absolute hell. Id have to give away like 50% of what i make on propfirm. Best is to buildup huge port to trade my own money and just pay 25% fix tax on capital gains. Fk this <:rofl:720062058640572446>

2024-12-30 17:15:09.501000 | mr_copy#0 | And remember with 1:2 average rr u are consistently making money above 33% winrate
2024-12-30 17:14:54.573000 | mr_copy#0 | Np sir.
But i can tell you, stuff changed ALOT when i considered HTF points of interest and daily bias. Accuracy was rising alot
2024-12-30 17:14:22.528000 | andylim.#0 | oh thanks for this
2024-12-30 17:13:51.655000 | mr_copy#0 | So once u got the setup idea done, work along daily/weekly bias.
I currently try to learn daily profiles to line up with daily bias
2024-12-30 17:13:19.171000 | mr_copy#0 | Fvg and ote line up is just my preference since it works rlly reliably for me. But htf context is rlly important
2024-12-30 17:13:00.129000 | mr_copy#0 | <@558566477972897794> 

I just want to see:
1. sweep (into HTF poi)
2. mss
3. entry criteria. 2 things lining up atleast. Fvg+ote, fvg+ob, fvg+ breaker etc etc
2024-12-30 17:12:44.334000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | a shitcoin
2024-12-30 17:12:42.452000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | no thats the right one

2024-12-30 17:11:23.367000 | mr_copy#0 | And if there is an FVG inside the .618-.786 then u got it lined up
2024-12-30 17:11:12.193000 | mr_copy#0 | If it sweeps a high timeframe high like pdhigh or taps into a daily fvg meanwhile and stuff lines up, you look for bearish setup.

Now lets assume we swept a pdhigh -> price comes down and shifts bearish = you now pull a fib from the top to the bottom of the price move that created the mss. There you have your OTE <@558566477972897794>

2024-12-30 17:05:12.997000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | depending on that close, that entry would be less ideal if it visits it again
2024-12-30 17:04:26.484000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | looks promising
2024-12-30 17:03:25.974000 | mr_copy#0 | Theoretical setup, but missed anyways fk it

2024-12-30 16:58:56.146000 | mr_copy#0 | Could go up earlier on pdlow sweep + setup etc but ye. Didnt check weekly etc timeframe. Id still assume it takes the lows

2024-12-30 16:55:27.682000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | ill tell you my gut reaction after you tell me
2024-12-30 16:55:25.051000 | mr_copy#0 | Alright depends on daily candle close today.
Prev day suggested bearish price action and wiping pdlow. It happened, but theres still some untapped daily lows. 
It almost tapped .618 which is a neat retracement.
So what id do now is:
go 4-1h and see if you get a bullish structure shift to start longing or take out the daily lows
2024-12-30 16:54:48.832000 | chinesecat888#0 | oh <:egg:1303082072424054805>

2024-12-30 16:51:27.498000 | mr_copy#0 | Depends on how the chart looks like
2024-12-30 16:51:13.574000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | on a 35% retracement?
2024-12-30 16:51:04.203000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | if a coin runs 350% and retraces 35% would you buy it?
2024-12-30 16:50:59.025000 | mr_copy#0 | Neither commodities or indices futures.
Crypto.. likely
2024-12-30 16:50:48.372000 | mr_copy#0 | For forex shouldnt be this insane tbh
2024-12-30 16:50:38.250000 | mr_copy#0 | But your mentioned 200-300 would require a massive overleverage or insane spread. Dunno. Lot size, time and asset vary it
2024-12-30 16:50:00.162000 | mr_copy#0 | Its kinda individual.
From my experience on MFFX:
-Sessions and news affect spread
-broker charges a fix commission per lot size (per 100k -> X$)
2024-12-30 16:49:15.626000 | mr_copy#0 | Oh this can appear if theres certain sessions starting etc.
Also diffrent to diffrent assets
2024-12-30 16:47:58.090000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | so i can launch ai meme coins and nfts and shill them to you lot

2024-12-30 16:47:18.387000 | gpdaudt#0 | Is there a change chart of spreads?
2024-12-30 16:45:57.393000 | gpdaudt#0 | Spreads are good now, but when I traded in the morning there was a 2x difference
2024-12-30 16:45:55.245000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | breakout traders would fade the rising wedge
2024-12-30 16:45:17.857000 | mr_copy#0 | Ye btc that too. So eth up on eth/brc would also support my idea
2024-12-30 16:45:09.703000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | the bot does not make mistakes, it reads your soul and knows deep down you are a scammer
2024-12-30 16:44:50.966000 | mr_copy#0 | Anyways for mffx i pay like 3$ per lot (per 100k size)
2024-12-30 16:44:46.589000 | wag0r#0 | it was the bots mistake
2024-12-30 16:44:43.323000 | wag0r#0 | i let him out
2024-12-30 16:44:42.707000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | I was referring to the eth/btc pair

2024-12-30 16:44:06.026000 | mr_copy#0 | Got a range trade idea for eth. In case it reclaims range. Sry for phone ss. Reclaim range ant tp on top, 1.618 and 2.618

2024-12-30 16:16:37.388000 | wilfstudio#0 | how would usdt ban even negatively affect the market, if people have usdt remaining and are european surely they either buy back in or just swap to fiat/another stable
2024-12-30 16:15:46.867000 | monkeyrithms#0 | i guess we could call Dec that, though
2024-12-30 16:15:27.499000 | monkeyrithms#0 | it would actually be "healthy" to have a crab Jan.. we want to see consolidation after moves up

hope it isn't total bear..lol... but you never know
2024-12-30 16:14:26.018000 | stormvanguardhaku#0 | have money in EUR <:sweetSleep:735176520229847100>
2024-12-30 16:14:00.691000 | monkeyrithms#0 | i think its pretty likely. Usually there's some tax selling after "santa rally" going into the new year... there's the USDT fud, yes (although I'm not seeing the kind of market reactions I typically associate with there being an "actual" threat, like maybe most of the exchanges aren't in Europe?),  and then there's going to be a natural selloff on the back of any prior rallies, which means there's been some trump-bump profit taking that I think actually sort of got in the way of a traditional santa rally type thing.

everything is "cyclical," so we just got off a really big rally.. it would not surprise me if we crab around Jan a bit

2024-12-30 01:47:17.471000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | It‚Äôs being distributed as cash

2024-12-30 01:45:09.233000 | eliann.#0 | So bearish
2024-12-30 01:45:01.288000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | They always result in sell offs

2024-12-30 01:40:45.612000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Litecoin got asics tho
2024-12-30 01:40:24.196000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Ethereum killed that
2024-12-30 01:40:19.788000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Back when Gpus were useful in crypto

2024-12-30 01:38:54.237000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | And faster block times is a vulnerability
2024-12-30 01:38:43.624000 | rello1028#0 | its either link or btc and eth
2024-12-30 01:38:27.118000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Nah Litecoin is like 2 mins
2024-12-30 01:37:44.527000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | with the proof of work shortened to 14 seconds from ten minutes
2024-12-30 01:37:43.292000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | So is everything
2024-12-30 01:37:26.784000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | Because it's a clone of bitcoin
2024-12-30 01:37:09.940000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Litecoin was cool 10 years ago
2024-12-30 01:36:46.522000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Why do noobs always gravitate to Litecoin? lol
2024-12-30 01:36:22.605000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Good to see
2024-12-30 01:36:19.678000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Eth finally getting some love
2024-12-30 01:35:39.168000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | So if Litecoin didn't do it yet, nah, I think altseason isn't here
2024-12-30 01:35:23.196000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | I would expect a nice boost in Litecoin.  It's popular, diversified holders probably, and it could ETF.  But no, not really, a little pump up and it got killed by FOMC too

2024-12-30 01:15:24.365000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | People would have varying views on what makes a coin desirable
2024-12-30 01:15:09.588000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | That's the thing that makes me think, it's not over yet
2024-12-30 01:14:55.743000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | What are we down to

2024-12-30 01:13:48.823000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | But I think, the desirability of different coins is more stratified now.
2024-12-30 01:13:20.078000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | But it hasn't gone to small caps yet.  It was starting to, but then the market imploded.. but the supply shock on Bitcoin probably hasn't changed
2024-12-30 01:12:47.538000 | Deleted User#0000 | Yessir
2024-12-30 01:12:41.617000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | SOL did too, but it could be more
2024-12-30 01:12:33.125000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | So, XRP, DOGE, got pumped up
2024-12-30 01:12:14.064000 | Deleted User#0000 | I think so
2024-12-30 01:12:06.015000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | AVAX is somewhat desirable
2024-12-30 01:11:54.512000 | Deleted User#0000 | Like Avax?
2024-12-30 01:11:44.620000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | So it goes in order, the next most desirable coin gets pumped up

2024-12-30 01:10:29.692000 | andrewbworth_39908_62186#0 | Supply shock, people want Bitcoin, but there's not enough/price too high

2024-12-29 14:58:09.347000 | mr_copy#0 | Atleast thats my view. Im not in your situation
2024-12-29 14:58:06.602000 | mr_copy#0 | Which again sounds like throwing out the budget. Your parents should learn how to spend/not spend. Basic money managment.  But this might not change if u keep throwing money at them tbh. You cant just single handedly carry the overspending or atleast shouldnt do that
2024-12-29 14:56:27.285000 | maddydamage#0 | my mom takes a million vacations my dad hasnt left the state since prior to covid

2024-12-29 14:55:58.206000 | mr_copy#0 | Question is why does your dad have a car and all that, but cant even afford the tires. This kinda sounds like living above their budget
2024-12-29 14:55:26.070000 | maddydamage#0 | while being poor but spending money
2024-12-29 14:55:20.315000 | mr_copy#0 | i helped out too, but parents are usually independent. I just helped with fixcost etc
2024-12-29 14:55:12.423000 | maddydamage#0 | all they do is constantly vacation
2024-12-29 14:54:57.134000 | mr_copy#0 | Happens and probably wont change
2024-12-29 14:53:58.401000 | maddydamage#0 | anyone ever been in a situation where your parents fianncially depend on you but none of your 3 other sibblings contribute
2024-12-29 14:49:54.716000 | maddydamage#0 | so fuckig annoying have to buy my dad tires for his car that I fucking paid for while my younger sister is an attorney and doesnt have to put in a penny to help with my parrents

2024-12-29 07:06:15.012000 | lleywyn#0 | Historically, after a halving event, Q1-Q3 in the following year are mostly red. 

A big drop in Q1, a slow bear market for Q2, and crab In Q3 leading up to a pump in Q4.

I think 110k was not the top. It's too small. It'll simmer down for a few months, but in December 2025, we'll see the real cycle top.

2024-12-29 05:09:54.339000 | sir7160#0 | Also a slightly red monthly close isn‚Äôt a bad set up for a rip roaring January candle.
2024-12-29 05:09:32.521000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Eerily similar to the 21 top. Then 3 months down before recovers

2024-12-29 04:59:33.688000 | sir7160#0 | A lot of designer bags go ballistic when the brand stops making the bag.
2024-12-29 04:59:18.874000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Could go up in value I guess

2024-12-29 04:57:42.645000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | I think I would look weird wearing a necklace
2024-12-29 04:57:41.606000 | sir7160#0 | I had the experience of WEARING an investment
2024-12-29 04:57:36.682000 | tingly2884#0 | Wouldn‚Äôt mine owning it but probably won‚Äôt go outta my way to get jewelry
2024-12-29 04:57:29.802000 | sir7160#0 | But then I bought a ring, and resold it for 2x

2024-12-29 04:55:35.086000 | sir7160#0 | In theory, gold, real estate, stonks, they‚Äôre all soft money
2024-12-29 04:55:22.106000 | sir7160#0 | They‚Äôre shifting funds from soft money to hard money
2024-12-29 04:55:16.246000 | tingly2884#0 | Once Elon starting mining planets gold is going to take shit in price

2024-12-29 04:54:48.470000 | sir7160#0 | But gold isn‚Äôt going anywhere
2024-12-29 04:54:43.547000 | sir7160#0 | It may not go up as fast, due to BTC absorbing more and more of the overall value in the global market
2024-12-29 04:54:36.502000 | lemon_squ33zy#0 | Idk real estate is in troubled waters
2024-12-29 04:54:17.032000 | sir7160#0 | Your house isn‚Äôt going to go down any time soon.
2024-12-29 04:53:51.708000 | sir7160#0 | What I like to consider is, *even if* nothing changes economically in the next 10 years, we‚Äôll still have 2.5x the debt by then, implying *at least* 2.5x the price (for everything) at that point.

2024-12-28 22:35:57.109000 | sir7160#0 | This combo is called a Gyro-Nair Delayed ZZ Double Toss. To give you the inputs,
Jump -> ZDrop -> FastFall Nair -> Short Hop FToss -> Regrab -> ZDrop -> Regrab FF Nair -> Dash SH FToss -> Regrab -> FToss -> Side B
This comes out to damn near 30 button presses (with precise timing!) in about 4 or 5 seconds.

2024-12-28 20:32:15.600000 | copperlark#0 | so many were buying bicycles and scooters off kazahs to cross
2024-12-28 20:32:03.440000 | copperlark#0 | it wasn't allowed to cross the border by foot
2024-12-28 20:31:56.787000 | copperlark#0 | During the Feb-March 2022 the Kazahstan land border was flooded with Russians

So i dunno i think thats not rlly great. Most developed safe countries have 1 or less
2024-12-28 19:50:21.567000 | copperlark#0 | Russians who moved to SA have chats I follow. For sure more dangerous than Russia. Dangerous to walk with your phone out, gonna get robbed at knife point for that easy
2024-12-28 19:49:33.717000 | copperlark#0 | Which other country (other than US) would have been the safest during WW2? Wouldn't want to be caught anywhere in Europe during a crisis like that

2024-12-28 19:48:55.818000 | mr_copy#0 | Of south america probably, but south america itself seems a bit problematic
